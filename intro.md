# DataScape  

Our Project: ConceptNet and Google Knowledge Graph will be used to generate semantic wordmaps based on Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) topics and Points of Light (POL) volunteer project categories. Wordmap themes will be visualized on D3 graphs, a world map using international job data, and related brain voxels using pycortex.

## Loggevity

How long is log?  

A triangle on a flat surface will gradually become a circle if the flat surface curves into a sphere.  

A circle on a sphere will appear to become a point if the spherical surface expands faster than the circle.
