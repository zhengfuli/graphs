Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) structure resembles the visual cortex of animals.

Geoffrey Hinton (2017) says capsule networks are even better for human-like accuracy in computer vision.
"When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active."

Spark SQL functions!

PySpark

Pandas for manipulating data frames and Plotly for charts 
since it uses d3.js and is much nicer than matplotlib for making charts.

AllenNLP - Presenter, py library structure with tests instead of notebooks. Uses VS Code.
